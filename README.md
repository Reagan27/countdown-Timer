A counter timer is an electronic device or circuit that is used to count the number of events or occurrences of a specific signal or pulse 
It is often used in electronic applications where timing and frequency measurement is crtical, such as in industrial automation,process control and instrumentation.
A counter timer typically consists of a counter circuit, which counts the number of input pulses and a timer circuit, which measures the time between input pulses.
The input pulses can be generated by an external source, such as a senior or a switch or by an internal clock.
Overall counter timers play a crucial role in many electronic applications by providing accurate and precise timing and frequency measurement
